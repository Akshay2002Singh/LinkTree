## Linktree is a web-based tool that allows users to create a personalized and customizable link hub, making it easier to share multiple links from a single location. It serves as a "link in bio" solution for social media platforms and other online profiles, where users often have limited space to share links. With Linktree, you can consolidate all your important links in one place and share a single, clean URL with your audience.
## This project is made using MERN.
